As the headline of this YouTube video extradites, we are going to install SQL Server on a local virtual machine; Sounds quite tedious and weary, right?
Well, I promise to surprise.

This is our Windows Operating System PC,

On this PC we will install VirtualBox.

Next, we will install Vagrant, a command line tool, which manages VirtualBox.

Finally, we will download a VagrantBox image for our VirtualBox; 

And here comes the surprise!
This is a Vagrant box image of SQL Server vNext running on Linux Ubuntu.

You probably ask yourself if you have heard right?
Running SQL Server vNext on Windows!?

Well, trying to manually download Windows Server and SQL Server images for your VM will take hours; Installing and spinning up even one machine will be time-consuming, and resource exhausting for your PC.

Ironically, with SQL Server vNext, running on Linux, this is not the case; 

The initial download of the required VagrnatBox image from SQL DevOps repository takes approximately 20 minutes. 

Spinning up one VM on a PC with SSD takes about 40 sec, 

and even running multiple VM's is resource affordable.
