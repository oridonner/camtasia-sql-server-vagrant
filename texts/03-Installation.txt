Installations
---------------------------
Now let's move on to the practical part.

We will do all are downloads with the help of Chocolatey - Windows package manager; 

If you haven't used Chocolatey before, go to chocolatey.org, click on  the "install chocolatey now" button 

(don't worry, nothing will be downloaded to your PC, it is just a link to the installation web page).

1. Open PowerShell Command Line Interface, as administrator, 2. Copy the PowerShell installation script from chocolatey installation web page to your shell.
3. Hit Enter.
4. If this is your first installation, you will have to reopen the Shell.

Since Chocolatey is already installed on my PC I will continue to VirtualBox and Vagrant installations; 

This step is quite straightforward: 
1. choco install VirtualBox 
2. choco install Vagrant
3. Again, if this is your first installation, you will have to restart your PC. Since Vagrant and VirtualBox are already installed on my PC, I will skip the restart. 

Now let's check if the installation has succeeded. 
1. Type VirtualBox in the Shell and hit enter - VirtualBox application will be opened.
2. Type Vagrant in the Shell and hit enter -Vagrant help will be scripted out. Since Vagrant is a command line tool, and It has no GUI.
