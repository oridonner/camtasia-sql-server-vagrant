In this video, I will show you a fast, and easy way to build, 
a resource affordable SQL Server Dev Environment on your PC.

If you are a SQL Server DBA, 
tired of asking the IT manager for more Dev resources, 
or if you just want to work offline.

Even if you are a SQL Server newbie, 
eager to build your first Dev Lab, 
you got to the right place!
