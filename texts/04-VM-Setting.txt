Configuration settings
-------------------------------
Now after all the required tools are installed, we can start setting the virtual machine:

1. Create a new directory; I will name it "mssql-vnext" as the servers name.

2. Get inside the new directory.

3. Type vagrant init, and hit enter.
A Vagrantfile was added to our new directory. The Vagrantfile is a configuration file written in the Ruby language. We will discuss this file later on. 

4. Open the Vagrantfile with your favorite text editor and delete the file content. 

5. Go to my blog post "3 good reasons for starting SQL Server vNext", scroll down to the "Vagrant box" paragraph and copy this code to the Vagrantfile. Don't forget to save the file. 

Now, lets have a closer look on the Vagrantfile.
