Vagrantfile
----------------

The first and most important thing to set is the VagrantBox. 
Vagrant uses a base image to clone a virtual machine. 
These base images are known as boxes.These boxes are saved on a global repository named Atlas ,and are available for all Vagrant users. 

Let's Google "Atlas boxes" and get inside Atlas repository.

Now, let's search for our vagrant box - "SQL server vnext".
Bingo! It is saved under the sqldevops namespace.  

To get more detailed information about the box and VM get inside the box's repository.
 

Back to our Vagrantfile,
Vagrant manages a local repository of vagrant boxes,
when a vagrantfile requests a vagrant box not listed in the local repo, 
vagrant downloads it from the global Atlas repository, to the local repo. This can be a bit time consuming.

The next thing to set on the vagrantfile is the network configurations.We will set the server on a local network with this IP, more network configurations are available on vagrant documentation.

Now everything is ready for spinning up the VM.
